# Parameter Specification:
# ----------------------------
# Param1=[PASS or FAIL]  :: Expected Regression Behavior.  Informs the script whether you expect the action to pass or fail.  Can be used for regression testing.
# Param2=[TRUE or FALSE] :: Exit Orchestration script on error
# Param3=Module Batch/Shell Script name to execute (no extension).  Extension is added by script.
# Param4=Module Action to execute
# Param5-ParamN=Specific space separated parameters for the action.  See Property Rules below.
#
# ----------------------------
# Property File Rules:
# ----------------------------
#   1. All parameters are space separated.  Commas are not used.
#         a. Any number of spaces may occur before or after any parameter and are trimmed.
#
#   2. Parameters should always be enclosed in double quotes according to these rules:
#         a. when the parameter value contains a comma separated list:
#                                    ANSWER: "ds1,ds2,ds3"
#
#         b. when the parameter value contain spaces or contains a dynamic variable that will resolve to spaces
#            i.   There is no distinguising between Windows and Unix variables.   Both UNIX style variables ($VAR) and
#                 and Windows style variables (%VAR%) are valid and will be parsed accordingly.
#            ii.  All parameters that need to be grouped together that contain spaces are enclosed in double quotes. 
#            iii. All paths that contain or will resolve to a space must be enclosed in double quotes.
#                 An environment variable (e.g. $MODULE_HOME) gets resolved on invocation CisDeployTool. 
#                       Paths containing spaces must be enclosed in double quotes:
#                              ANSWER: "$MODULE_HOME/LabVCSModule.xml"
#                       Given that MODULE_HOME=C:/dev/Cis Deploy Tool/resources/modules, CisDeployTool automatically resolves the variable to
#                       "C:/dev/Cis Deploy Tool/resources/modules/LabVCSModule.xml".
#
#         c. when the parameter value is complex and the inner value contains spaces
#			 i. In this example $PROJECT_HOME will resolve to a path that contains spaces such as C:/dev/Cis Deploy Tool
#                       For example take the parameter -pkgfile $PROJECT_HOME$/bin/carfiles/testout.car.
#                       Since the entire command contains a space it must be enclosed in double quotes:
#                              ANSWER: "-pkgfile $PROJECT_HOME/bin/carfiles/testout.car"
#
#   3. A comment is designated by a # sign preceeding any other text.
#         a. Comments may occur on any line and will not be processed.  
#
#   4. Blank lines are not processed 
#         a. Blank lines are counted as lines for display purposes
#         b. If the last line of the file is blank, it is not counted for display purposes.
