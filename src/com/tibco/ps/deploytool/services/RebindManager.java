	 * Rebind all of the resources in a given starting folder and its sub-folders to a designated "toFolder"
	 *   where the path of the resource discovered in the starting folder path matches the "fromFolder".
	 *   
	 *   Objective 1 - When both the "fromFolder" exists and the "toFolder" exists use the rebindResource API.
	 *                 The rebindResource API requires that both the from path and to path exist.
	 *   Objective 2 - When the "fromFolder" does not exist and the "toFolder" exists perform a textual path
	 *                 replacement on the script text or transformation source path and then rebind by invoking 
	 *                 the specific CIS API for the resource sub-type as seen in the section "Textual Path
	 *                 Replacement Rules" below.
	 *   Objective 3 - When the "toFolder" does not exist in all cases, throw an exception because it is not
	 *                 permitted to rebind to a target folder that does not exist.
	 *      
	 * Textual Path Replacement Rules:
	 * ------------------------------
	 *  Caveat:
	 *      For textual path replacement, when the "fromFolder" does not exist and the SQL_TABLE (Views) and 
	 *      SQL_SCRIPT_PROCEDURE (Procedures) have models, the model is lost.  The reason is there is no way
	 *      to programatically create a model in the API.   For parameterized queries this is unfortunate as
	 *      there is no way to rebuild the model once removed.  For Views, the model can be regenerated in
	 *      most cases.
