	PDTool will no longer be maintained due to complexities of maintaining and testing over several TIBCO DV releases.
	
	Even though PDTool provides a robust mechanism for deployment that offers a great deal of flexibility, 
		it has become increasingly difficult to maintain with many TDV 8.x releases.
		
	The key feature of PDTool is its ability to integrate with Version Control Systems (VCS) namely GIT and Subversion.
	
	The VCS capability (alone) has been migrated to a PSG managed and provided accelerator called TIBCO PSG CoE (Center of Excellence).
		To acquire this capability would require a PSG engagement to install, configure and train on how to use.
		TIBCO PSG CoE is a command-line based tool for Windows and Linux like PDTool is.  However, it does not offer ANT like PDTool does.
		TIBCO PSG CoE supports all aspects of deployment differently than PDTool and similarly supports VCS deployment from GIT or Subversion only.
