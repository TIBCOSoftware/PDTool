The example files were created by invoking the following CIS Procedure:
   /shared/Utilities/repository/lowerLevelProcedures/getBasicResourceXML
   
The response was pasted into an XML Editor such as Stylus Studio to format the XML

The examples are useful for a programmer to see what elements and attributes exist for a given resource.

getBasicResourceXML:
	-- CIS Repository Helper Procedure --
	This procedure retrieves the XML resource metadata for a given resource.  An XML response is returned.
 	This is a lower level procedure that gets called by other higher level procedures including:
		getBasicResourceCursor(), getBasicResourceCursor_ActionAttributes(), getBasicResourceCursor_SQL_TABLE().
	Generally speaking you should be invoking one of those higher level procedures instead of this one unless you
	absolutely need the XML returned.

	Input:
		fullResourcePath - Full resource path which includes the path and the resource name  
			Values: e.g. /shared/Utilities/repository/examples/source
		resourceType - Type of CIS resource to be created
			Values: see "TYPES / SUBTYPES" listing below.  e.g. CONTAINER
	Output:
		resourceResponse - XML response containing the resource metadata
			Values: XML
	Exceptions:  none
