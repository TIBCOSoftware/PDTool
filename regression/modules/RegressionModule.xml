			<!-- Type of test: [functional|migration|performance] 
				functional - Only execute the default query against a table or procedure.  For a web service it is whatever input is provided.  
								This test only cares about whether the resources executes or not.  Results may be output if the logFilePath contains a file path.
							 	If the input file contains a full query, it will be rewritten using the FROM clause to use the default queries described in the <newFileParams> section
				migration - A full query like "select * from <table> where <where_clause>" is executed so that a result set is returned and saved to a file.  
								A second instance of this test is executed and the result files are compared for equality.
				regression - A full query like "select * from {table} where {where_clause}" is executed so that a result set is returned and saved to a file.  
								A second instance of this test is executed and the result files are compared for equality. 
								Note: functionally the same as migration but provided as a way of documenting the test type.								
				performance - A full query like "select * from <table> where <where_clause>" is executed repeatedly on multiple threads for a specified duration of time to capture results.	
								A performance test does not write results to an output file.  It is only concerned with gathering statistics on executions.
