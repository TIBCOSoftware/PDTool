# PubTest Input File 
# Version: 
# 
# There are two types of entries allowed in this file: 
#   SQL queries and web service calls. 
# 
# The format of a SQL query is 
# 
#   [QUERY] 
#   database=<name of published database> 
#   outputFilename=<(optional) The name of the file to be used for Regression Test output otherwise filename is constructed as best effort from the "FROM" clause.> 
#   <one or more lines containing the query ended by a blank line.> 
# 
#    Query Governor:  Use SELECT TOP n column-list to limit the number of rows returned. 
# 
# The format of a SQL stored procedure call is 
# 
#   [PROCEDURE] 
#   database=<name of published database> 
#   outTypes=<list of comma separated java.sql.Types JDBC type names> 
#   outputFilename=<(optional) The name of the file to be used for Regression Test output otherwise filename is constructed as best effort from the "FROM" clause.> 
#   <one or more lines containing the call statement or select statement ended by a blank line.> 
# 
#    Query Governor:  Use SELECT TOP n column-list to limit the number of rows returned.
# 
#    For SELECT or CALL statements only IN and INOUT parameter values need to be provided. 
#    Select will not work for procedures containg more than one OUT or INOUT parameter if one of them is a cursor. 
# 
#    outTypes should only be used if the procedure has non-cursor output values. 
#    Each non-cursor output value is represented by a ? in the query. 
#    The number of type names in outTypes should match the number of ? in the query. 
# 
# The format of a web service call is 
# 
#   [WEB_SERVICE] 
#   database=<name of published web service> 
#   path=<path to the port of the published web service.  Legacy WS uses soap11.  CIS 6.1 and higher WS may use soap11 or soap12. > 
#   action=<the web service operation to execute> 
#   encrypt=<use http (unencrypted) or https (encrypted) [true|false] > 
#   contentType=<soap header content type: [soap11=text/xml;charset=UTF-8 | soap12=application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8] > 
#   outputFilename=<(optional) The name of the file to be used for Regression Test output otherwise filename is constructed as best effort from the "path" + "action".> 
#   <input document> 
# 
# The path will be prefixed with "http://<host>:<wsPort>/". 
# The input can span multiple lines. A blank line terminates the input.
